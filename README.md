# Geek Throttle

This is a small project designed to teach students about the concept of throttling in programming.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. [`index.html`](index.html): This is the main HTML file that renders the user interface.
2. [`script.js`](script.js): This JavaScript file contains the logic for throttling.
3. [`README.md`](README.md): This file provides an overview of the project.

## What is Throttling?

Throttling is a technique used in programming to control the number of times a function can be executed over time. It's particularly useful in scenarios where a function could potentially be called many times in a short period, such as when handling events like scrolling or resizing in a web page.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, students should be able to:

- Understand the concept of throttling and its usage in programming.
- Implement a basic throttling function in JavaScript.
- Apply throttling to handle events efficiently in a web page.

I hope you find this project helpful in your learning journey!
